* [General feedback and discussions](#general-feedback-and-discussions)
* [Reporting security issues and bugs](#reporting security-issues and bugs)
* [Contributing code via a pull request](#contributing-code-via-a-pull-request)
* [Engineering guidelines](#engineering-guidelines)
* [GitHub Flavored Markdown](#github-flavored-markdown)

## General feedback and discussions
Please start a discussion on the Issue tracker for the relevant repo e.g. * [SSW Data Onion 2 Issues](https://github.com/SSWConsulting/SSW.DataOnion2/Issues)   .

## Reporting security issues and bugs
Security issues and bugs should be reported privately, via email, to SSW  sswdevelopers@ssw.com.au You should receive a response within 24 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

## Filing issues
When filing issues, we ask you to use the [bug filing templates](https://github.com/aspnet/Home/wiki/Functional-bug-template) from the ASP.NET team.
The best way to get your bug fixed is to be as detailed as you can be about the problem.
Providing a minimal project with steps to reproduce the problem is ideal.
Here are questions you can answer before you file a bug to make sure you're not missing any important information.

1. Did you read the documentation for the project?
2. Did you include the snippet of broken code in the issue?
3. What are the *EXACT* steps to reproduce this problem?
4. What package versions are you using (you can see these in the `project.json` file)?
5. What operating system are you using?
6. What version of IIS are you using?

GitHub supports [markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/), so when filing bugs make sure you check the formatting before clicking submit.


## Contributing code and content

If you've found and fixed a bug, or have a new feature you would like to add we would love you to chip in.

Here are a few tips
* Make sure you can build the code.
* Familiarize yourself with the project workflow and our coding conventions.
* If you don't know what a pull request is read this article: [Using pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests).
* Before submitting a feature or substantial code contribution please discuss it with the team and ensure it follows the product roadmap. You might also read these two blogs posts on contributing code: [Open Source Contribution Etiquette](http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2010/Dec-31.html) by Miguel de Icaza and [Don't "Push" Your Pull Requests](https://www.igvita.com/2011/12/19/dont-push-your-pull-requests/) by Ilya Grigorik.
* Note that all code submissions will be rigorously reviewed and tested by the SSW team, and only those that meet an extremely high bar for both quality and design/roadmap appropriateness will be merged into the source.
* To make sure your pull-request makes it into the project please ensure you carefully read the
[Engineering guidelines](ENGINEERING-GUIDELINES.md) and the [Contributing Process](CONTRIBUTING-PROCESS.md)
